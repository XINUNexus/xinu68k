# Xinu-68K

***Xinu Is Not Unix***

## Description

Xinu is a small, elegant operating system that supports dynamic
process creation, dynamic memory allocation, network communication,
local and remote file systems, a shell, and device-independent I/O
functions.

Although it shares concepts and even names with Unix, the internal
design differs completely.

It's small size makes it suitable for embedded environments.
