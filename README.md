**_Xinu Is Not Unix_** ... for 68000 systems

## Description

Xinu is a small, elegant operating system that supports dynamic process
creation, dynamic memory allocation, network communication, local and remote
file systems, a shell, and device-independent I/O functions.

differs completely.

It's small size makes it suitable for embedded environments.
