This dir contains the files to build gnulib for the MECBs.
(gnulib contains support routines for the more obscure arithmetic
operations for gcc.)  These files were copied from 
/usr/local/gnu/src/gcc
on Feb. 12, 1989, and the only edit was to the Makefile to
change cc to "cc -m68010 -S" and then add "as -10 -h..."
to produce 68000-pure library code.
Just "make gnulib" to build it.

Then "ar qc gnulib ../libxc/lmult.o"  to add lmult.o from Sun libc.a
to this library to make it self-sufficient.  Some routines in gnulib,
when compiled by cc, call lmult.

Feb 28, '91--tried to rebuild it without eprintf, clearly not
wanted for sa work.  as no longer takes -10 or -h.  Substituted
-mc68010 for -10 and dropped -h (why did we need it before??)
Got a couple of assembler errors, but look like float support
anyway.  In addition to lmult.o, need ldivt.o, lmodt.o, and ptwo.o
from C lib.
